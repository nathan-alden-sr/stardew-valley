## Goals

- Plant a Kale crop
- Mine and smelt in The Mines

## Advice and warnings

- When you reach Mining level 5, choose the [Miner](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining/Skill) profession.
- You will eventually reach floor 120. When you do, farm the following floors for the types of Ore you need:
  - Floor 21 for Copper Ore
  - Floor 41 for Iron Ore
  - Floor 81 for Gold Ore
- While mining, be on the lookout for one of each of four [Minerals](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Minerals) required for the [Geologist's Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Geologists_Bundle) on Spring 15:
  - [Quartz](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quartz)
  - [Earth Crystal](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Earth_Crystal)
  - [Frozen Tear](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Frozen_Tear)
  - [Fire Quartz](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fire_Quartz)
- While mining, try and acquire two of the four items required for the [Adventurer's Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Adventurers_Bundle):
  - 99 [Slime](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Slime)
  - Ten [Bat Wing](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bat_Wing)
  - One [Solar Essence](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Solar_Essence)
  - One [Void Essence](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Void_Essence)
  - It's probably easiest to acquire one Solar Essence and one Void Essence, but you will likely also acquire many more than ten Bat Wings.
- If it rains today or over the next couple of days you will have to decide whether you can afford to take time off from mining to fish in Cindersap Forest.

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. Deposit your entire inventory into Chests. Withdraw the following:
   - Scythe
   - Axe
   - Hoe
   - Watering Can
   - If you did not ship any fish yesterday, enough fish to purchase half the Kale Seeds
2. Water the Bean Starter and Mixed Seed crops.
3. Harvest the Kale.
   - You should reach Farming level 2.
4. Start tilling Kale Seed planting spots in an interlocked Sprinkler pattern. Check the spreadsheet to see how many Sprinklers are necessary for the number of Kale Seeds you need to plant. See the [second Kale crop planner](https://stardew.info/planner/15-happy-sparrows-walked-merrily) for a suggested plan. Mixed Seeds are depicted by a generic crop icon.
5. Stop work at 8:00 am.
6. If you need to sell fish then travel to the Fish Shop; otherwise, travel to the Blacksmith and skip to the [Pelican Town](#pelican-town) section below.

### Beach

1. Sell fish to Willy.
2. Travel to the Blacksmith.

### Pelican Town

1. Speak to Clint to receive the Gold Pickaxe.
2. Travel to Pierre's General Store.
3. Purchase the calculated number of Kale Seeds.
4. Travel to The Farm.

### The Farm (2)

1. Finish tilling and planting. Do not water any Kale crops.
   - You can optionally craft [Cobblestone Path](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cobblestone_Path) to mark the location of Sprinklers; however removing them when it comes time to place Sprinklers will take extra time and Energy.
   - You will not water the Kale until Spring 14.
2. Deposit your entire inventory into Chests. Withdraw the following:
   - Gold Pickaxe
   - Furnace
   - All Copper Ore
   - All Iron Ore
   - All Gold Ore
   - All Coal
   - All Stone
   - Source of Energy, usually Common Mushrooms or Chub
   - Your best [Weapon](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Weapons) if you fished one up
3. Travel to The Mines.

### The Mines

1. Place the Furnace to the right of the elevator again.
2. Continue your descent while keeping the Furnaces smelting as often as reasonable.
   - As you acquire more Copper Ore and Stone, craft and place three more Furnaces.
   - You need the required number of Copper Bars and Iron Bars by Spring 14. Prioritize smelting Iron Bars since they take longer than Copper Bars.
   - You need one extra Copper Bar and Iron Bar, and one Gold Bar by Spring 15 for the Blacksmith's Bundle.
   - Return to floor 0 of The Mines to smelt more Bars every time you reach a new elevator.
3. Mine until 1:50 am.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
   - Do not withdraw any of the following:
     - Ore
     - Bars
     - Coal
     - Stone
     - Your Weapon
5. Pass out.

## Day's end

- Farming level 1 ⟶ 2
- Mining level increases may occur
  - If you reach Mining level 5, choose the [Miner](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining/Skill) profession.
