## Goals

- Fish at The Mountain

## Instructions

### The Farm

1. Water crops.
2. If two days have elapsed since Demetrius' visit, check The Cave for Mushrooms.
3. Use the spreadsheet to calculate how many additional Kale you need to reach Farming level 6.
   - The Kale will be planted in two batches. Planting in two batches cuts the number of Sprinklers needed--and thus Iron Bars needed--in half, leaving more Iron Bars for [Quality Sprinklers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quality_Sprinkler) later.
   - If you need an odd number of Kale then the spreadsheet will show a fractional number. In this case, it is your choice whether to plant the extra Kale Seed in this first batch or wait until the second batch.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into Chests. Withdraw the following:
   - Fiberglass Rod
5. If you have Fishing level 10, ship enough fish to purchase half of the Kale Seeds; otherwise, do not ship any fish.
6. If you have less than 100 Bait on the Fiberglass Rod, use the spreadsheet to calculate how many Bait you need to purchase and the cost of the Bait. Withdraw enough fish to sell to Willy in order to purchase the minimum required Bait.
7. Travel to The Mountain fishing spot.

### The Mountain (1)

- If you have at least 100 Bait on the Fiberglass Rod:
  1. Fish until 1:50 am.
  2. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
     - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
  3. Break the Furnace and pick it up.
  4. Pass out.

- If you do not have at least 100 Bait on the Fiberglass Rod:
  1. Fish until 9:00 am.
  2. Travel to the Fish Shop.

### Beach

1. Sell enough Fish to Willy to purchase the minimum required Bait.
2. Travel to The Mountain fishing spot.

### The Mountain (2)

1. Fish until 1:50 am.
2. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
3. Break the Furnace and pick it up.
4. Pass out.

## Day's end

- (Unlikely) Fishing level 9 ‚ü∂ 10 (choose the Angler profession)
