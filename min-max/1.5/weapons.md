# Weapons

## Progression

When you first enter [The Mines](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines), a cutscene plays, after which [Marlon](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Marlon) gives you the [Rusty Sword](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Rusty_Sword). However, if you are lucky, you may have fished up a [Broken Trident](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Broken_Trident) or [Neptune's Glaive](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Neptune%27s_Glaive) from a fishing chest. Subsequently, you will use [Weapons](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Weapons) received via chests, containers, barrels, or certain [Monsters](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Monsters) like Special [Slimes](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Slimes).

## Galaxy Sword

After obtaining your first [Prismatic Shard](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Prismatic_Shard) from [Skull Cavern](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skull_Cavern), visit the three pillars in [The Desert](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/The_Desert). While the Prismatic Shard is selected, touch the tile at the center of the three pillars. The game will take the Prismatic Shard and award you the [Galaxy Sword](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Galaxy_Sword).

If you happen to acquire your first Prismatic Sword in early floors of Skull Cavern, it may be beneficial to exit and acquire the Galaxy Sword, then re-enter Skull Cavern. The Galaxy Sword makes combat much more efficient.

## Infinity Blade

Eventually, you will want to upgrade the Galaxy Sword to the [Infinity Blade](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Infinity_Blade).
