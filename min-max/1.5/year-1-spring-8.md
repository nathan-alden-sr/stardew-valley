## Goals

- Fish at The Mountain

## Advice and warnings

- When you earn 25,000g in total, Demetrius will visit The Farm. He will give you a choice between mushrooms and fruit bats. Choose mushrooms. Once you've made the choice you will generally want to check [The Cave](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Cave) every day for [Mushrooms](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Foraging).
- It is possible, although unlikely, to reach Fishing level 10 today if you are very skilled and lucky. If you reach it today, choose the [Angler](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fishing#Fishing_Skill) profession.

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. Deposit your entire inventory into chests. Withdraw the following:
   - Enough items to ship to reach the G target calculated by the spreadsheet
     - You will need 10,000g for the Gold Pickaxe upgrade and 2,000g for the Backpack upgrade.
     - If you can't reach the G target right now, you will have to return to The Farm tonight to ship the remainder.
   - Watering Can
2. Ship items.
3. Water crops.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into Chests. Withdraw the Fiberglass Rod.
5. Travel to The Mountain fishing spot.

### The Mountain

- If you shipped 12,000g worth of items:
  1. Fish until 1:50 am. Continuously smelt Gold Bars.
  2. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
     - Five Gold Bars
     - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
  3. Pass out.
- If you did not ship 12,000g worth of items:
  1. Fish until 1:00 am. Continuously smelt Gold Bars.
  2. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
     - Five Gold Bars
     - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
  3. Travel to The Farm.

### The Farm (2)

1. Ship the remainder of items to reach the G target calculated by the spreadsheet.
2. Pass out.
