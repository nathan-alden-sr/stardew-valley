## Goals

- Fish at The Mountain

## Advice and warnings

- When you earn 25,000g in total, Demetrius will visit The Farm. He will give you a choice between mushrooms and fruit bats. Choose mushrooms. See the [Other Notes](https://github.com/Zamiell/stardew-valley/blob/master/Min-Max_Guide.md#other-notes) section in Zamiell's guide.
- It is possible, although unlikely, to reach Fishing level 10 today if you are very skilled and lucky. If you reach it today, choose the [Angler](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fishing#Fishing_Skill) profession.

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. Water crops.
2. Ship enough items to reach the G target calculated by the spreadsheet
   - You will need 10,000g for the Gold Axe upgrade and 2,000g for the [Backpack](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tools#Other_Tools) upgrade.
   - If you can't reach the G target right now, you will have to return to The Farm tonight to ship the remainder.
3. Travel to The Mountain fishing spot.

### The Mountain

- If you shipped 12,000g worth of items:
  1. Fish until 2:00 am.
  2. Pass out.
- If you did not ship 12,000g worth of items:
  1. Fish until 1:00 am.
  2. Travel to The Farm.

### The Farm (2)

1. Ship the remainder of items to reach the G target calculated by the spreadsheet.
2. Pass out.

## Day's end

- (Unlikely) Fishing level 9 ‚ü∂ 10 (choose the Angler profession)
