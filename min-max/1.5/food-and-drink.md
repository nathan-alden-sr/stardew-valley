# Food and drink

## Energy per Gold (EPG)

Every food or drink that restores [Energy](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Energy) and [Health](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Health) does so at an implicit cost in G. It is wise to be aware of what you are "paying" when consuming food items. To calculate the EPG for a particular item, use the following formula:
```
Energy Granted / Sell Price
```
The higher the EPG, the more efficient the food item is.

Realistically, calculating and following EPG is only necessary in the early game. Eventually, you will acquire many tens of Iridium [Chub](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Chub), which will hold you over until you begin consuming food for its buffs or easy availability rather than its Energy-restoring efficiency. The guide provides an EPG table when you'll need it.

After you begin running [Skull Cavern](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skull_Cavern), you will begin to acquire [Cheese](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cheese) and [Salad](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Salad) as your preferred foods.
