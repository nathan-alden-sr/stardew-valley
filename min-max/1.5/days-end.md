# Day's end

## Passing out and Exhaustion

### Energy restoration

Passing out and/or [Exhaustion](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Energy) penalize you with a 50% reduction in that night's Energy restoration. This penalty can be avoided by leveling up [Skills](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skills) that same night. The guide uses leveling up strategically to allow you to pass out for maximum productivity.

### G total

Passing out penalizes you 10% of your G total at day's end. The penalty does *not* apply to any G earned from shipping items that day. The [spreadsheet](spreadsheet.md) allows you to easily account for whether you plan on passing out when calculating the next day's G total.
