## Advice and warnings

- Any tilled tiles on which you are planting Wheat Seeds must be watered by tomorrow. If they aren't watered, the Wheat crop will not be ready for harvest on Fall 2.

## Instructions

1. Till the tiles you will be planting the Wheat linger crop on.
2. Craft and place Sprinklers so that the newly-tilled tiles are watered overnight.
3. At 9:00 am, travel to Pierre's General Store and purchase Wheat Seeds, then return to The Farm and plant them on the newly-tilled tiles.
