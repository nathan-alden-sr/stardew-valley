## Goals

- Upgrade the Steel Pickaxe to the Gold Pickaxe
- Fish at The Mountain

## Advice and warnings

- At least one Potato Seed must be planted by this day, watered every single day, and not eaten by Crows in order to successfully complete the Spring Crops Bundle on Spring 15. Usually, you will plant enough Mixed Seeds on Spring 1 to randomly give at least one Potato.
- Failing to reach Fishing level 10 today does not alter the run in any meaningful way.

## Instructions

### The Farm

1. Deposit your entire inventory into Chests. Withdraw the following:
   - Axe
   - Watering Can
2. Water crops.
3. Fell Trees until 8:00 am.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into Chests. Withdraw the following:
   - Five Gold Bars
5. Travel to the Blacksmith.

### Pelican Town

1. Upgrade the Steel Pickaxe to the Gold Pickaxe for 10,000g.
2. Travel to Pierre's General Store.
3. Purchase the Backpack upgrade for 2,000g.
4. Travel to The Mountain fishing spot.

### The Mountain

1. Fish until 1:50 am.
2. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet.
3. Pass out.

## Day's end

- (Likely) Fishing level 9 ⟶ 10 (choose the Angler profession)
