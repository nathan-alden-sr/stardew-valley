# Stardew Valley 1.5 Min-Max Guide

## Introduction

This guide is inspired by [Zamiell's guide](https://github.com/Zamiell/stardew-valley/blob/master/Min-Max_Guide.md), which itself is inspired by several other sources. However, I was not happy with how the guide is laid out, the presentation of each day's tasks, and the overall thoroughness. After running Year 1 [Spring](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spring) over and over again, making many mistakes, and taking voluminous notes, I decided to write my own guide. My hope is that you will avoid many of the mistakes I made and thus have a more enjoyable experience.

## Spreadsheet

I created a [spreadsheet](spreadsheet.md) in [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download) that I use to easily calculate many things--everything from what I need to ship to reach target G amounts, how many Ore I need to find to craft enough Bars, etc. The spreadsheet automates item information in several places.

## Crop planning

The guide occasionally includes links to specific crop plans generated in the amazing [Stardew Planner](https://stardew.info/planner) tool. These plans are invaluable for quickly knowing where exactly to till or place [Sprinklers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crafting#Sprinklers) and [Scarecrows](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Scarecrow). Mixed Seeds are depicted by a generic crop icon.
