## Goals

- Unlock the Community Center
- Fish at The Mountain

## Advice and warnings

- If your Bean Starter or your last Cauliflower was eaten by a Crow then you will not be able to complete the Spring Crops Bundle on Spring 15.
- Your only Farm Chest may be getting full by this point. If so, fell Trees for an additional 50 Wood and craft a second Chest. Place it next to the first Chest.

## Instructions

1. Water crops.
2. Craft a Scarecrow and place it on the spot indicated on the crop planner.
3. Fell Trees until 7:40 am.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Retrieve the following:
   - Fiberglass Rod
5. Travel to Pelican Town via the Bus Stop. When you transition to Pelican Town, the Community Center cutscene will trigger.
   - Do not skip the cutscene. If you skip it the game will place you at the entrance to Pelican Town instead of the Community Center door.
6. Enter the Community Center and interact with the golden scroll in the lower left room. This interaction triggers the Wizard entry in your journal tomorrow.
7. Travel to The Mountain fishing spot.
8. Fish until 1:00 am.
9. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - Five Iron Bars
   - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
   - Do not withdraw any Gold Ore, Gold Bars, or the rest of the Coal. You will be smelting Gold Bars tomorrow.
10. Travel to The Farm.
11. Ship enough items to reach the G target calculated by the spreadsheet
    - You will need 5,000g for the Steel Axe upgrade and enough G to purchase the remaining Gold Ore you need to acquire 25 in total
12. If time allows, cut Weeds and Grass.
13. Pass out.
