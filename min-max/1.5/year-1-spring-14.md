## Goals

- Mine and smelt
- Craft and place Sprinklers

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. Check the Television and learn the [Coleslaw](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Coleslaw) recipe from The Queen of Sauce.
2. If two days have elapsed since the last time you checked The Cave, check it now for Mushrooms.
3. Deposit your entire inventory into Chests. Withdraw the following:
   - Sources of Energy if you don't have them stored in the Chest in The Mines
   - Watering Can
4. Water Mixed Seed crops.
5. Deposit the Watering Can in a Chest.
6. Travel to The Mines.

### The Mines

1. Withdraw the Gold Pickaxe from the Chest.
2. Continue your descent while keeping the Furnaces smelting as often as reasonable.
   - You will need the required number of Copper Bars and Iron Bars before 12:00 am.
   - Remember you need one extra Copper Bar and Iron Bar, and one Gold Bar for the Blacksmith's Bundle.
3. Mine until 12:00 am.
   - Prioritize Iron Ore and Gold Ore once you have the required Copper Bars. Copper Ore is now only useful for tool upgrade and crafting more Furnaces later.
   - You may want to stop mining a bit earlier if you need to spend time breaking Cobblestone Paths before placing Sprinklers.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - All Copper Bars
   - All Iron Bars
   - All Gold Bars
   - A Quartz for the Geologist's Bundle
   - An Earth Crystal for the Geologist's Bundle
   - A Frozen Tear for the Geologist's Bundle
   - A Fire Quartz for the Geologist's Bundle
   - Ten Bat Wings for the Adventurer's Bundle
   - One Solar Essence or Void Essence for the Adventurer's Bundle
   - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
   - Do not withdraw any Ore or Coal.
5. Travel to The Farm.

### The Farm (2)

1. Deposit one Copper Bar, one Iron Bar, and one Gold Bar into a Chest for the Blacksmith's Bundle tomorrow.
2. Remove any Cobblestone Floors from Sprinkler tiles.
3. Craft and place as many Sprinklers as possible with your remaining bars. Any missing Sprinklers can be crafted and placed on subsequent days.
4. If you have 42,500g worth of items, ship them now to reach that target; otherwise, ship 32,500g worth of items.
   - If you are only able to ship 32,500g worth of items, do not complete the [10,000g Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Vault) tomorrow. You will likely need to allocate a day between Spring 15 and Spring 17 to fish for the required 10,000g. Try and wait for a rainy day.
5. If time allows, cut Weeds and Grass.
6. Pass out.

### Day's end

- Mining level increases may occur
  - If you reach Mining level 5, choose the [Miner](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining/Skill) profession.
