## Goals

- Fish at The Mountain

## Advice and warnings

- There are two ways you can travel to [The Mountain](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mountain) or [The Mines](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines) from The Farm: through the Backwoods or through Pelican Town. It is nearly 20 in-game minutes faster to travel via the Backwoods.

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. If he didn't appear yesterday, Clint will appear and give you the plans for crafting Furnaces.
2. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the Watering Can.
3. Water crops.
4. If you do not have 150 Wood, withdraw the Axe and Scythe from the Chest and fell Trees in the same manner as before until you have 150 Wood. You can fell Oak Trees now that they will drop Acorns.
   - The 150 Wood is for two more Chests and a [Scarecrow](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Scarecrow).
5. Craft a Chest and keep it in your inventory.
6. Deposit your entire inventory into The Farm Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - Fiberglass Rod
   - The newly-crafted Chest
   - Chub for eating if you took them with you yesterday
7. Travel to The Mountain.

### The Mountain

1. Travel to the fence at the bottom of the screen and continue traveling east from there. Place the Chest on the east-most tile on the row of tiles just above the south-most row of tiles.<br />![The Mountain Chest](images/year-1-sprint-4-the-mountain-chest.png)
2. Fish so that your bobber lands one tile southeast of the underwater stone. This tile is Fishing Zone 5. Casting beyond this tile has no benefit.<br />![The Mountain Bobber](images/year-1-sprint-4-the-mountain-bobber.png)
3. Fish until 1:00 am.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - All Ore
   - All Coal
   - All Gems
   - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
5. Travel to The Farm.

### The Farm (2)

1. Ship all sellable items except for the following:
   - All Chub (you'll be eating them for Energy)
   - One of each fish that is used in Community Center Bundles
   - All Ore
   - All Coal
   - All [Diamonds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Diamond), [Emeralds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Emerald), [Jade](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jade), and [Rubies](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ruby) for future [Skull Cavern](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skull_Cavern) trips
   - Consider keeping items that don't sell for much (e.g., Wood). Gathering Wood at this point is Energy-intensive and time-consuming and each Wood only sells for 2g.
   - Consider keeping certain rare Artifacts like [Ancient Seed](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ancient_Seed) or other Artifacts that don't sell for much. They can be used later to complete your Museum collection.
2. If time allows, cut Weeds and Grass.
3. Pass out.

## Day's end

- Fishing level 6 ⟶ 7
