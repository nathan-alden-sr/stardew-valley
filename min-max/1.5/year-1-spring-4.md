## Goals

- Fish at The Mountain

## Advice and warnings

- There are two ways you can travel to [The Mountain](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mountain) or [The Mines](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines) from The Farm: through the Backwoods or through Pelican Town. It is nearly 20 in-game minutes faster to travel via the Backwoods.
- Clint will appear and give you the plans for crafting Furnaces if you acquired your first Copper Ore yesterday.

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the Watering Can.
2. Water crops.

- If you are purchasing more Bait at the Fish Shop:

  1. If you do not have 100 Wood, withdraw the Axe and Scythe from the Chest and fell Trees in the same manner as before until you have 100 Wood. You can fell Oak Trees now that they will drop Acorns.
     - The 100 Wood is for one more Chest and a [Scarecrow](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Scarecrow).
  2. Deposit your entire inventory into The Farm Chest. Withdraw the following:
     - Fiberglass Rod
     - The Hoe if you still need an Artifact
     - Chub for eating if you took them with you yesterday
     - The fish you took with you yesterday for the Bait purchase
  3. Skip to [The Beach](#the-beach) section below.

- If you are not purchasing more Bait at the Fish Shop:

  1. If you do not have 150 Wood, withdraw the Axe and Scythe from the Chest and fell Trees in the same manner as before until you have 150 Wood. You can fell Oak Trees now that they will drop Acorns.
     - The 150 Wood is for one more Chest and a [Scarecrow](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Scarecrow).
  2. Craft a Chest and keep it in your inventory.
  3. Deposit your entire inventory into The Farm Chest. Withdraw the following:
     - Fiberglass Rod
     - The newly-crafted Chest
     - Chub for eating if you took them with you yesterday
  4. Skip to [The Mountain](#the-mountain) section below.

### The Beach

1. Check the sand for forageables and Artifact Spots.
2. Sell all fish and Beach forageables at the Fish Shop. Save the lowest-quality [Sardine](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sardine) for the [Ocean Fish Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Ocean_Fish_Bundle).
   - You may need to make multiple trips to the Chest before it's empty. As soon as the Chest is empty and you have a free inventory slot, break the Chest and pick it up.
     - To break a Chest without a tool, select an empty slot in your inventory and hold down the left mouse button on the Chest. Your character will strike it repeatedly until it pops free.
3. If you acquired a Copper Ore yesterday, purchase as much Bait as possible; otherwise, save 75g so you can purchase a Copper Ore from the Blacksmith later.
   - You should be able to purchase at least 400 Bait, and usually you can expect to receive more from fishing chests. The Bait should last all Spring. Usually you will not require more than 500 Bait. If you can afford more than 500 Bait, choose whether the extra G or the extra Bait is more important to you. Be aware of the 10% penalty for passing out.
   - You may choose to purchase one or two [Trout Soups](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Trout_Soup) to assist with catching Catfish. They will raise your Fishing level when eaten, but they have a lower EPG (0.4) than Iridium-quality [Chub](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Chub) (0.65 EPG).
4. If you saved 75g to purchase Copper Ore from the Blacksmith, go purchase it now. This ensures Clint appears at The Farm tomorrow and gives you plans to craft [Furnaces](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Furnace).
   - You do not have to drop the Copper Ore on the ground or otherwise do anything special with it.
5. Travel to The Mountain.

### The Mountain

1. Travel to the fence at the bottom of the screen and continue traveling east from there. Place the Chest on the east-most tile on the row of tiles just above the south-most row of tiles.<br />![The Mountain Chest](images/year-1-sprint-4-the-mountain-chest.png)
2. Fish so that your bobber lands one tile southeast of the underwater stone. This tile is Fishing Zone 5. Casting beyond this tile has no benefit.<br />![The Mountain Bobber](images/year-1-sprint-4-the-mountain-bobber.png)
3. Fish until 1:00 am.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - All Ore
   - All Coal
   - All Gems
   - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
   - Alternatively, you can leave Ore, Coal, and Gems in the Chest and take more items to sell. You will have to remember to come back to the Chest tomorrow to pick up those items before visiting The Mines.
5. Travel to The Farm.

### The Farm (2)

1. Ship all sellable items except for the following:
   - All Chub (you'll be eating them for Energy)
   - One of each fish that is used in Community Center Bundles
   - All Ore
   - All Coal
   - All [Diamonds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Diamond), [Emeralds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Emerald), [Jade](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jade), and [Rubies](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ruby) for future [Skull Cavern](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skull_Cavern) trips
   - Consider keeping items that don't sell for much (e.g., Wood). Gathering Wood at this point is Energy-intensive and time-consuming and each Wood only sells for 2g.
   - Consider keeping certain rare Artifacts like [Ancient Seed](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ancient_Seed) or other Artifacts that don't sell for much. They can be used later to complete your Museum collection.
2. If time allows, cut Weeds and Grass.
3. Pass out.
