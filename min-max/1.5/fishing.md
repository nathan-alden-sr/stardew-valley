# Fishing

- After your bobber is in the water, you can hold down the left mouse button waiting for a hit, then release it after a hit. Depending on your reflexes this can be slightly faster than pressing the button on a hit.
- As you are reeling in a caught [Fish](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fish), hold down the left mouse button to skip the bubble that appears to show you what you caught. This saves a small amount of time per catch. Immediately recast after the Fish enters your inventory.
- In [Spring](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spring), fish in [Cindersap Forest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cindersap_Forest) on rainy days and [The Mountain](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mountain) on dry days. [Catfish](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Catfish) sell for twice as much as [Largemouth Bass](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Largemouth_Bass).
- In [Summer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Summer), fish at [The Beach](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Beach).
- Refer to the following table for the most efficient items to eat from fishing (higher [Energy](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Energy) per G is better)

  | Item | Quality | EPG |
  | ---- | ------- | --- |
  | [Green Algae](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Green_Algae) | N/A | 0.87 |
  | [White Algae](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Green_Algae) | N/A | 0.8 |
  | [Seaweed](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Seaweed) | N/A | 0.65 |
  | [Joja Cola](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Joja_Cola) | N/A | 0.52 |
  | [Chub](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Chub) | Iridium | 0.43 (assumes you have the [Angler](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fishing#Fishing_Skill) profession) |

- Although the [Experience](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skills) multiplier of a perfect catch (2.4) is slightly higher than a fishing chest (2.2), favor the fishing chest because the rewards can more than make up for the slight Experience loss.
- The maximum number of new items you can receive after a single catch is five (one Fish plus four fishing chest items). Be sure you have enough free inventory slots to receive all items.
- Only fish in bubbles if the [Fishing Zone](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fishing#Fishing_Zone) is high enough to catch Iridium- and Gold-quality Fish. Otherwise, although your hit rate will increase, you will fish up more [Trash](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Trash) and lower-quality Fish.
- Casting beyond Fishing Zone 5 tiles has no benefit, even if it's a max cast.
