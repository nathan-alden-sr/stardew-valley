# Mining

## Ladders

- Killing every [Monster](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Monsters) on a floor increases the chance of a ladder appearing after breaking a rock by four percentage points. Whether you decide to do this depends on a few factors:
  - The quantity and difficulty of Monsters
  - The time it will take to kill all Monsters on the floor vs. breaking rocks
  - Your [Weapon's](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Weapons) damage
  - The day's [Luck](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Luck); usually, you will only want to attempt this on small floors with a few Monsters
- Consider quickly scanning a small floor before mining to see if a ladder is already exposed.

## Floor transitions

After taking an elevator or ladder, pause the game as soon as the screen begins to fade in. This allows the fade-in to complete and for you to scan the floor without the clock running.

## Saving certain items

Avoid selling [Bat Wings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bat_Wings), [Solar Essences](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Solar_Essence), and [Void Essences](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Void_Essence) if possible. They are needed for crafting as you progress through the game.

## Explosives

Proper use of Explosives is critical to being as time- and resource-efficient as possible. Each Explosive has a different Tiles per G (TPG) ratio and different crafting requirements. Be sure you keep enough Resources in your inventory to be able to craft any of the four at any time.

### TPG based on raw materials selling price

| Explosive | Tiles Affected | Raw Materials Selling Price | TPG | Use |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | --- | --- |
| [Bombs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bomb) | 96 | 55g | 1.745 | Slowly destroy large, dense patches of rocks |
| [Explosive Ammo](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Explosive_Ammo) (requires a [Slingshot](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Weapons#Slingshot)) | 21 | 19g | 1.105 | Quickly destroy small, dense patches of rocks |
| [Mega Bombs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mega_Bomb) | 197 | 190g | 1.037 | Slowly destroy huge, dense patches of rocks |
| [Cherry Bomb](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cherry_Bomb) | 36 | 35g | 1.029 | Slowly destroy small, dense patches of rocks |

### TPG based on based on Dwarf purchase price

| Explosive | Tiles Affected | Dwarf Purchase Price | TPG | Use |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | --- | --- |
| [Explosive Ammo](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Explosive_Ammo) (requires a Slingshot) | 21 | 60g (300g for a stack of five) | 0.35 | Quickly destroy small, dense patches of rocks |
| [Mega Bombs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mega_Bomb) | 197 | 1000g | 0.197 | Slowly destroy huge, dense patches of rocks |
| [Bombs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bomb) | 96 | 600g | 0.16 | Slowly destroy large, dense patches of rocks |

## The Mines

### Reaching floor 120 of The Mines

Starting on Year 1, [Spring](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spring) 11, your goal is to reach floor 120 of [The Mines](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines) as soon as possible.

- As soon as you uncover or spot a ladder, stop any additional mining and take the ladder to continue your descent. The only exception to this--and it's still optional--is if you spot one of the [Gems](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Minerals#Gems) needed for [Skull Cavern](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skull_Cavern):
  - [Diamond](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Diamond)
  - [Emerald](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Emerald)
  - [Jade](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jade)
  - [Ruby](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ruby)
- Until you upgrade the Pickaxe, skip mining the light gray rocks as they take two hits to destroy.
- Elevators are on every floor whose number is evenly divisible by five. When reaching a new elevator, travel back to floor 0 and deposit your inventory into Chests, smelt additional Ore, etc. It can be helpful to keep Ore, [Coal](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Coal), and [Stone](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stone) in your inventory so you can better track how much of each [Resource](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Category:Resources) you have, and so you can craft [Staircases](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Staircase) for [Infested Floors](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines#Infested_Floors).
- If you plan on passing out and you don't think you can reach the next elevator, consider [farming Ore](#farming-ore), instead.
- When you reach floor 100, do not take the [Stardrop](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardrop) unless you need the energy. If you do pass it up, remember to take it later.

### Farming Ore

Farm Ore on the following floors:

- Floor 21 for [Copper Ore](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Copper_Ore)
- Floor 41 for [Iron Ore](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iron_Ore)
- Floor 81 for [Gold Ore](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Gold_Ore)

### Farming Coal

Coal can be a bottleneck any time you need to smelt lots of Bars or Refined Quartz. Farm Coal on floor 41. Not only is this a good place to farm Coal but it will also help you acquire the [Burglar's Ring](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Burglar%27s_Ring) by killing 500 [Dust Sprites](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Dust_Sprite).

## Skull Cavern

### Bus

Once you repair the [Bus](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bus_Stop), starting the next day, [Pam](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pam) will leave her trailer just after 8:30 am. If you block her path on the [Pelican Town](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pelican_Town) and Bus Stop screens, she will arrive at the Bus more than 30 in-game minutes sooner than otherwise.

You should only need to take the Bus once to get to [The Desert](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Desert). On your first trip, bring a quantity of [Omni Geodes](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Omni_Geode) that is evenly divisible by three with you. Trade them to the [Desert Trader](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Desert_Trader) for a [Warp Totem: Desert](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Warp_Totem:_Desert) per three Omni Geodes.

### Desert Trader

Trade with the Desert Trader for very useful items:

- Trade three Omni Geodes for a Warp Totem: Desert
  - Once you have a good supply of Warp Totem: Deserts, consider saving Omni Geodes to break them open at the [Blacksmith](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Blacksmith)
- Trade one Diamond for one [Triple Shot Espresso](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Triple_Shot_Espresso)
- Trade one Emerald for one [Cheese](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cheese) (only on Fridays)
- Trade one Jade for one Staircase (only on Sundays)
- Trade one Ruby for one [Spicy Eel](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spicy_Eel)
- Trade three [Prismatic Shards](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Prismatic_Shard) for one [Magic Rock Candy](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Magic_Rock_Candy) (only on Thursdays)

### Descending

- In general, ignore all enemies in favor of breaking rocks
  - After acquiring a stronger weapon like the [Galaxy Sword](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Galaxy_Sword), killing certain enemies can be useful in certain circumstances (e.g., killing [Iridium Crabs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iridium_Crab) to easily obtain [Crab Cakes](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crab_Cakes) and Iridium Ore)
  - The infamous [Serpent](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Serpent) Monsters can pass through walls and will often to force you to kill them before proceeding. If you are quick with your controls, it is possible to run in the direction you were wanting to go, break one or two rocks, then turn and resume fighting.
- Certain floors and floor layouts will cause you to waste a lot of time running from rock to rock and will not spawn enough rocks to warrant [Explosive](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crafting#Bombs) usage. On these floors, craft a Staircase and place a ladder immediately.
  - The long spiral floor
  - The long vertical floor
  - Any floor where you hit a dead-end and there are no additional rocks to break
- On floors with a chest, the game will always give you one visible ladder. Break the few remaining rocks in the hopes of quickly uncovering a hole.
- See [BlaDe's spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19c3V-XkhFh-4UQSRIpXdvgngZ0Ex9F7REOeay7MVVvE) for detailed information about Ore spawning rates

### Diamond and Jade farming

As you craft [Crystalariums](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crystalarium), you will have to decide whether your playstyle favors consistent movement speed Buffs from a large stack of Triple Shot Espresso (Diamond) or extra Staircases (Jade). Consider favoring Jade because it replicates in only 25% of the time of Diamond.

### Magic Rock Candy

- The [Buffs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Buffs) granted, especially +4 Luck, should more than make up for the lost 6,000g of income from selling the Prismatic Shards directly in terms of extra [Iridium Ore](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iridium_Ore) (you only need four extra Iridium Bars to break even)
- Save Magic Rock Candy for unlucky days
- Use Magic Rock Candy as soon as you enter Skull Cavern to more quickly get to lower floors

### Iridium Pickaxe

Don't upgrade to the [Iridium Pickaxe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pickaxes) until Summer, Year 1. You will lose too much income not running Skull Cavern for up to two days.
