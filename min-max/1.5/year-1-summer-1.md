## Advice and warnings

- Do not clear any dead Parsnips as the game would turn some of the tilled tiles back to dirt overnight. You will clear them tomorrow.
- Reaching Foraging level 7 as soon as possible is important because it allows you to craft [Tree Fertilizer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tree_Fertilizer). You can use the Tree Fertilizer to quickly grow Oak Trees in your Oak Tree forest. A large forest will allow you to more quickly acquire the [Oak Resin](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Resin) necessary for [Keg](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Keg) crafting.
  - Instead of felling Trees, consider using [Seed Makers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Seed_Maker) acquired from Skull Cavern to make [Summer Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Summer_Seeds) from [Spice Berries](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spice_Berry). You can acquire a large amount of Summer Seeds this way, which yield forageables that are quickly harvested.
- On days where you do not visit Skull Cavern, consider doing the following:
  - Searching for Summer forageables to reach Foraging level 7 as soon as possible
    - Consider grabbing [Robin's Lost Axe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quests#Robin.27s_Lost_Axe) in southeast Cindersap Forest and bringing it to her when you visit her for your [Stable](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stable) purchase. You will be rewarded with 250g.
  - Chopping stumps and gathering [Fiddlehead Ferns](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiddlehead_Fern) in the [Secret Woods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods) for Foraging Experience and Hardwood. The [Stable](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stable) requires 100 Hardwood and the Farmhouse upgrade requires 150 Hardwood.
- Consider repairing the bridge at The Beach for 300 Wood to reach Summer forageables on the other side.
- After every [stormy](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Weather) day, be sure to gather any [Battery Packs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Battery_Pack) from Lightning Rods. Lightning Rods cannot intercept lightning strikes if a Battery Pack is available to be gathered.
- The latest that [Summer Crops Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Summer_Crops_Bundle) crops may be planted is Spring 21, assuming Deluxe Speed-Gro is used.
