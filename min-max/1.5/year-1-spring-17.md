## Advice and warnings

- You should try and reach floor 120 in The Mines today, as well as complete the 10,000g Bundle. Any further delays will begin to hinder your ability to purchase a maximum amount of [Starfruit Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Starfruit_Seeds) in [Summer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Summer).
- Once you have reached floor 120 in The Mines, break all the Furnaces, pick them up, move them to The Farm, and place them. A good spot for the Furnaces is to the right of the Farmhouse because they won't interfere with tillable tiles.
- Mine in Skull Cavern as soon and as often as possible. See the [Skull Cavern guide](mining.md#skull-cavern).
- The day after you visit Skull Cavern for the first time, [Mr. Qi](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mr._Qi) will send you a letter with a challenge to reach floor 25. Once you reach floor 25, check the mail the next day and claim the 10,000g reward.
- You need to reach Mining level 10 and choose the [Blacksmith profession](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining#Mining_Skill) by no later than day's end of Spring 23. This will ensure you make maximum profit selling [Iridium Bars](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iridium_Bar) on Spring 24.
- Use the spreadsheet's *Y1-Sp Starfruit Planning* tab to track all necessary items for those activities.
- Coal in particular is a bottleneck for this part of the run. Avoid smelting Bars or crafting [Bombs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bomb) or [Explosive Ammo](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Explosive_Ammo) unnecessarily.
- Prioritize smelting Iridium Bars over other Resources needed for Quality Sprinklers; the Iridium Bars are needed earlier than the Quality Sprinklers.
- You need to begin preparing The Farm for Summer. The timing of when to do this depends on your preferences, how efficient you are, and when the second Kale crop matures. The earliest the crop can mature is Spring 26, which leaves slightly less than three days to prepare The Farm. It is recommended that you wait until the end of Spring because you need to use the time before Spring 24 to earn as much income as possible for your first Starfruit Seeds purchase on Spring 25. See the [Starfruit crop planner](https://stardew.info/planner/12-light-ants-danced-merrily) for a suggested plan.

  Farm activities you need to perform:
  - Clearing Weeds, Grass, Stones, and branches where your Quality Sprinklers, Starfruit Seeds, and Scarecrows will go
  - Marking Quality Sprinkler tiles with Cobblestone Paths
  - Crafting and placing Scarecrows
  - Crafting and placing extra Furnaces with spare Copper Ore (try and craft enough to keep your Ore supply low by smelting)
  - Planting Acorns to build up a forest of Oak Trees
  - Farming Ore and Coal on floors 21, 41, and 81
  - Felling Trees to acquire Wood to craft more Chests
- Quality Sprinklers require one Iron Bar, one Gold Bar, and one [Refined Quartz](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Refined_Quartz) to craft. Smelt Bars and Refined Quartz evenly such that the total number of each you acquire is the same for all three types. This also helps inform you of what types of Resources you need to farm.
