## Goals

- Speak to 26 NPCs around Stardew Valley (it's actually 28, but the game gives you credit for having spoken to [Lewis](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Lewis) and [Robin](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Robin))
- [Forage](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Foraging) [Spring](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/spring) forageables
- Start farming
- Reach Foraging level 1

## Advice and warnings

- See [Parsnips crop planner](https://stardew.info/planner/32-heavy-rabbits-hugged-merrily) for a suggested [Parsnip](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Parsnip) and [Scarecrow](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Scarecrow) layout. [Mixed Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mixed_Seeds) are depicted by a generic crop icon.
- You need to have collected enough forageables by the end of the day to have enough money to purchase the [Fiberglass Rod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiberglass_Rod) and enough [Bait](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bait_(item)) before [Willy](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Willy) closes his shop on [Spring](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spring) 2.
- You must mine and store at least one [Stone](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stone) at some point during the day for Spring 2.
- Pause often! It's instantaneous, free, and allows you to think.

## Instructions

### Acquiring Foraging level 1

1. Pause.
2. Reorganize your [hotbar](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Inventory) as desired.
3. Set game options. It is recommended to set Zoom Level to 75% in order to see more of the map.
4. Unpause.
5. Take the [Parsnip Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Parsnip_Seeds).
6. Fell a mix of nine [Maple Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Maple_Tree) and [Pine Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pine_Tree). Do not fell any [Oak Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Tree) as the [Acorns](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Acorn) are needed for later and we can't get Acorns until reaching Foraging level 1.
   - Do not gather any Tree Seeds embedded in the ground as they are destroyed at Foraging level 0.
   - Pick Trees that are close to one another to minimize extra walking.
   - At Foraging level 0, every tree takes ten chops to fell.
   - Do not chop down the stumps as this wastes energy.
   - Determine what direction you want the tree to fall in, then chop from the opposite side. Usually, it's best to fell a tree such that it lands closer to the next tree you plan to fell. You can also stand perpendicular to the tree and slightly to the opposite side. This can save having to walk around the stump.
   - It's faster to manually click with perfect timing than to hold down the mouse button. This is a key skill you should develop early as it applies to [Mining](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining), as well.
   - As soon as a Tree begins falling, move to where the center of the boughs will hit the ground and pause. The falling animation, item spawning, and item collection will continue while the game is paused.
7. Craft a [Chest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Chest) and place it next to the [Farmhouse](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farmhouse). A recommended spot is [here](images/year-1-spring-1-farmhouse-chest.png). Transfer all inventory to the Chest except for the [Scythe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Scythe), [Axe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Axe), [Pickaxe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pickaxe), and [Hoe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hoe).
8. Exit [The Farm](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Farm) south to [Cindersap Forest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cindersap_Forest). You will likely have to use the Scythe to cut through [Weeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Weeds) and use the Pickaxe to break a Stone or two to get through. Try to time the screen transition for 9:20 am.
   - If you felled Trees quickly enough, you may have some extra time to use the Scythe to cut Weeds to get extra [Fiber](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiber) and Mixed Seeds.

### Cindersap Forest

Tips:

- While moving through areas that can spawn forageables, constantly scan the screen to be sure you spot them. Try and route your path efficiently. Stay on the "inside line" of any direction changes you take.
- Use the Scythe to chop Weeds, but only if they are near your path. Try and time your swings such that the maximum number of Weeds are chopped per swing.
- Sometimes, forageables can be partially or completely hidden behind Trees and bushes. It's not worth the time it takes to check behind every Tree, however.

Instructions:

1. Head west past the [Traveling Cart](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Traveling_Cart) area.
2. Head south toward the [Abandoned House](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Abandoned_House).
3. Head east toward the area where [Spring Onions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spring_Onion) spawn.
   - When foraging grouped items, stand in the center of a 3x3 box containing as many items as possible. Drag the right mouse button over all the items to rapidly collect them.
   - Spring Onions may sometimes spawn down the stairs near the drain.
4. Speak to [Jas](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jas) as she leaves [Marnie's Ranch](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Marnie%27s_Ranch) at approximately 11:20 am. She paths west after exiting the building.
5. Spend a few seconds chopping Weeds to the south of Marnie's Ranch. You want to time your arrival at [Emily's](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Emily) bedroom door for 12:00 pm.
6. Speak to [Haley](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Haley) as she walks west toward [Leah](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Leah)'s house.
7. Walk east and transition to [Pelican Town](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pelican_Town).

### Pelican Town: First Visit

Tips:

- It's always faster to walk toward NPCs to speak to them instead of waiting for them to walk to you.

Instructions:

1. Check the two [Garbage Cans](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Garbage_Can) near [Jodi's](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jodi) and Haley's houses.
   - Pause immediately after checking the trash. Identical to Trees falling, the game will continue to process the animations, item spawning, and item collection.
2. Speak to Emily inside her house. If you timed it correctly, you should meet her just as she opens her bedroom door.
3. Exit Emily's house, walk east, and speak to [Penny](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Penny) to the west of the [Graveyard](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Graveyard).
4. Walk north and speak to [Marnie](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Marnie) as she walks south from [Pierre's General Store](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pierre%27s_General_Store).
5. Walk south and transition to the [Beach](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pierre%27s_General_Store).

### The Beach

Tips:

- Do not forage any Beach forageables. We need the free inventory slots for other forageables. We will collect them on subsequent days.

Instructions:

1. Walk southeast and speak to [Elliott](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Elliott).
2. Check for [Artifact Spots](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artifact_Spot) and hoe them up.
3. Walk north and transition to Pelican Town.

### Pelican Town: Second visit

1. Walk east toward the [Museum](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Museum). If you hoed up an [Artifact](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artifacts) on the beach then donate it to the Museum and claim the 250g reward, then exit the Museum.
2. Walk east and check the Museum's Garbage Can.
3. Walk north and west, then check the [Blacksmith's](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Blacksmith) Garbage Can.
4. Enter the Blacksmith, walk behind the counter, and speak to [Clint](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Clint).
5. Exit the Blacksmith, then walk east and north to the Garbage Can on the east side of [JojaMart](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/JojaMart).
6. Walk west and enter JojaMart.
7. Speak to [Pam](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pam), then [Sam](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sam), then [Shane](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Shane).
8. Exit JojaMart, walk to the west, then north, then east around the back of JojaMart.
9. Clear the fenced area of weeds.
   - The tile blocking the fenced area will randomly be a Weed, a Stone, or a branch, so have the correct tool selected before you get to the tile.
10. Walk west and speak to [Abigail](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Abigail) on the bridge.
11. Walk north and speak to [Maru](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Maru) as she walks south.
12. Walk southwest toward Lewis' house.
13. Check the Garbage Can next to Lewis' house.
14. Walk west and speak to [Caroline](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Caroline) and [Jodi](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jodi).
15. Walk west and speak to [Vincent](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Vincent).
16. Walk north and speak to [Harvey](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Harvey).
17. Walk west and chop all Weeds next to the fence.
18. Walk north and east and enter Pierre's General Store.
19. Speak to Leah.
20. Walk behind the counter and speak to [Pierre](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pierre).
21. Exit Pierre's General Store, then walk south to the east side of [The Stardrop Saloon](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Stardrop_Saloon).
22. Check the Garbage Can outside of The Stardrop Saloon.
23. Enter The Stardrop Saloon, walk behind the counter, and speak to [Gus](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Gus).
24. Exit The Stardrop Saloon, walk east and north toward [George's](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/George) house.
25. Check the Garbage Can outside of George's house.
26. Enter George's house, walk into the east room, and speak to George.
27. Speak to [Alex](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Stardrop_Saloon) as he exits his bedroom at 4:00 pm.
28. Exit George's house, walk west, and transition to the [Bus Stop](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bus_Stop).

### The Bus Stop: First visit

1. Walk west. Just before you transition to The Farm, turn your character east, stand near the south side of the path, and drop all forageables on the ground. It may take several attempts to drop them as the game seems to choose random distances when throwing items.

### The [Backwoods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Backwoods)

1. Clear a path to the Backwoods. Try and chop as many Weeds as possible to maximize the chance for Mixed Seeds.
2. Transition to the Backwoods at 6:10 am.
3. Walk north and east and transition to [The Mountain](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mountain).

### The Mountain

1. Walk east and speak to [Linus](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Linus) near his tent.
2. Walk south, southeast, then west and speak to [Demetrius](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Demetrius).
   - You do not need to speak to Robin as the game already considers you as having met her.
3. If [Sebastian](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sebastian) is outside his house, speak to him. If he's inside his house, walk inside and speak to him there, then exit the house.
4. Walk south and transition to Pelican Town.

### Pelican Town: Third visit

1. Go south, then west behind the [Community Center](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Community_Center).
2. Clear the fenced area of weeds.
   - The tile blocking the fenced area will randomly be a Weed, a Stone, or a branch, so have the correct tool selected before you get to the tile.
3. Walk west past the fountain and chop weeds near the edge of the screen.
4. Walk south, then west, and transition to the Bus Stop.

### The Bus Stop: Second visit

1. Pick up the forageables you dropped. Occasionally, you may not have room for all the items. If this occurs, eat all the Spring Onions you gathered. If you still don't have room, transition to The Farm, deposit everything but your tools into the Chest, then transition to the Bus Stop to collect any remaining forageables.
2. Transition to The Farm.

### Planting crops

1. Eat any remaining Spring Onions.
2. Clear enough ground to plant 15 Parsnip Seeds and whatever Mixed Seeds you carry, plus a few more spots for Mixed Seeds in case you gather more shortly.
3. Plant and water Parsnip Seeds and Mixed Seeds.
4. Fell Trees until you have around four to six energy. The remaining energy will be useful if you gather more Mixed Seeds shortly.
   - If you don't have enough energy to fully fell a Tree, spend the energy mining Stone or chopping a stump.
5. Chop weeds and grass until around 1:30 am. Don't stray too far from the Farmhouse.
6. Ship all items except for the following:
   - All [Wood](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wood)
   - All stone (one is needed for Spring 2)
   - All coal
   - 20 Fiber
   - One of each Spring forageable you collected (you may not have all four types): [Wild Horseradish](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wild_Horseradish), [Daffodil](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Daffodil), [Leek](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Leek), and [Dandelion](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Dandelion). These will be used for the [Spring Foraging Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Spring_Foraging_Bundle) later.
7. Plant and water Mixed Seeds.
   - You can work past zero energy, but not too much, otherwise the game will force you to pass out and you will wake up on Spring 2 with half energy. If you do become exhausted, be sure you have enough time to make it into the Farmhouse.
8. Enter the Farmhouse at 1:50 am.
9. Pick up the [Single Bed](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Single_Bed) and optionally trash it with the Trash Can. This forces the game to spawn you one pixel from the doorway every morning, thus reducing walking time.
10. Pick up the [Television](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Television) and move it as close to the doorway on the left side as you can. When waking every morning, you can right-click the Television's stand to interact with it.
11. Pass out.

### Day's end

- Foraging level 0 ⟶ 1
