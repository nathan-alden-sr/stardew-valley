## Advice and warnings

- As you craft Kegs, place them in the Farmhouse. Later, purchase [Big Sheds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Shed) from Robin and place them there. Once you unlock the [Quarry](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quarry), you may also place them there; however, you will need to place flooring first.

## Instructions

1. Harvest the first Starfruit crop and plant the second crop.
   - Do not sell any Starfruit. Starfruit is much more valuable when turned into [Wine](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wine).
   - Do not sell any Starfruit Wine until after you change professions from [Agriculturist](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farming#Farming_Skill) to [Artisan](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farming#Farming_Skill).
2. You will reach Farming level 10 at day's end. Choose the Agriculturist profession.
   - Agriculturist will not affect today's harvest.
   - You will change professions to Artisan later before selling any Starfruit Wine.
