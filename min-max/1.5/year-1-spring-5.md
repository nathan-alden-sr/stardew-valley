## Goals

- Mine and smelt in The Mines
- Upgrade the Pickaxe to the Copper Pickaxe
- Plant a [Kale](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Kale) crop
- Fish at The Mountain

## Advice and warnings

- Spring 5 can be especially challenging as it is heavily RNG-dependent, specifically for the following:
  - The day's Luck
  - Ladders
  - The spawning of Ore and Gem [Nodes](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining#Mining_Nodes)
  - The spawning of mine carts and miner's bags containing Coal
  - Monster density
  - Room layouts
  - [Infested Floors](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines#Infested_Floors)
- Clint will appear and give you the plans for crafting Furnaces if you acquired your first Copper Ore yesterday.
- See the [first Kale crop planner](https://stardew.info/planner/34-useful-deer-married-easily/) for a suggested plan. Mixed Seeds are depicted by a generic crop icon.
- At least one [Bean Starter](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bean_Starter) must be planted by this day, watered every single day, and not eaten by Crows in order to successfully complete the Spring Crops Bundle on Spring 15.
- When playing a female character, it's likely that you will receive letters from [Dad](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mom_and_Dad) soon. Each letter contains 500g as a reward for earning 5,000g and 15,000g in total, respectively. If you are diligent about tracking how much you've earned and you will reach one or both thresholds by tomorrow, you can reduce the spreadsheet's G target by the appropriate amount at day's end.
- When playing a male character, it's likely that you will receive a letter from [Mom](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mom_and_Dad) soon. The letter contains a [Cookie](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cookie) as a reward for earning 15,000g in total. If you are diligent about tracking how much you've earned and you will reach the threshold by tomorrow, you can reduce the spreadsheet's G target by the sale price of a Cookie at day's end.

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. From now on, check the Television at the start of every day to reveal today's [Luck](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Luck).
2. Choose to accept or decline the pet. See the [Pet guide](pets.md).
3. Harvest the Parsnip crop and use the spreadsheet to track how many you harvested. The count will be used in Experience calculations later.
4. If you followed the Parsnip crop planner then your Mixed Seeds were kept separate from your 15 Parsnips. Compare the crops' appearance with images on the Stardew Wiki to see if the crop is a Cauliflower or a [Potato](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Potato). If you do not have a Cauliflower then you will not be able to complete the Spring Crops Bundle on Spring 15 as it is too late to plant a Cauliflower and have it mature by that day.
5. Claim the Parsnip harvesting reward of 100g in your journal.
6. Do not water any crops until the guide instructs you to.
7. Craft a Chest and keep it in your inventory.
8. Use the spreadsheet to track how many [Iron Ore](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iron_Ore) and [Gold Ore](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Gold_Ore) you have (they are sometimes acquired from fishing chests). The count will be used in purchasing calculations later.
9. Deposit your entire inventory into The Farm Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - Pickaxe
   - All Copper Ore
   - All Iron Ore
   - All Gold Ore
   - All Coal
   - All Gems except Diamonds, Emeralds, Jade, and Rubies
     - Diamonds, Emeralds, Jade, and Rubies are needed for Skull Cavern runs.
   - All Stone
   - All but three Parsnips
     - You need one for the Spring Crops Bundle, optionally one to ship, and optionally one for Pam.
10. Travel to The Mines.

### The Mines

Advice and warnings:

- At least 16 Coal must be acquired, including any previously acquired, in order to smelt five Copper Bars, five Iron Bars, five Gold Bars, and to craft a Scarecrow. Floor 12 seems to always be a long horizontal hallway that ends in a Coal minecart or Coal bag if you are running low on Coal.
- You may acquire Mixed Seeds by cutting Weeds in The Mines. You may plant these on The Farm if you wish.

Instructions:

1. Place the Chest just to the left of the elevator.
2. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - [Rusty Sword](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Rusty_Sword)
   - Pickaxe
   - Copper Ore
   - Coal
   - Stone
   - Parsnips
   - Keeping the Copper Ore and Stone in your inventory make it easier to track when you have enough resources to craft a Furnace.
3. Begin descending into The Mines with the goal of reaching floor 10 as quickly as possible. See the [mining guide](mining.md#the-mines).
   - Pay extra attention to acquiring the required 16 Coal.
   - Eat Parsnips for Energy.
4. As soon as you acquire 25 Copper Ore and 25 Stone, return to the floor 0 via the ladder or elevator, craft and place a Furnace near the elevator, and begin smelting a Copper Bar.
   - The time at this point should be anywhere from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm. Any later than 12:30 pm and it can become very difficult to acquire enough Resources to make it to the Blacksmith on time.
   - You can deposit Stone into the Chest now since you no longer need to track the quantity.
5. Resume your descent.
   - If your ladder luck is poor, you may need to return to the floor 0 before reaching the next elevator to begin smelting another Copper Bar.
6. Once you reach floor 10, stop your descent and farm floor 10 repeatedly until you have enough Copper Ore to smelt continuously. You must have four or five Copper Bars smelted before 3:00 pm.
   - If you've only crafted four Copper Bars by 3:00 pm, you can place the Furnace inside the Blacksmith's shop and craft the last Copper Bar there. However, this may not leave you enough time to make it to Pierre's General Store.
7. Continue following instructions only after you've acquired five Copper Bars or 3:00 pm arrives (whichever comes first).
8. Deposit your entire inventory into the chest. Withdraw the following:
   - Pickaxe
   - Furnace
   - Five Copper Bars
   - Up to 25 Iron Ore
   - Up to 25 Gold Ore
   - 11 Coal
   - All Gems
   - Any other items you wish to take back to The Farm (e.g., Fiber, Mixed Seeds, etc.)
     - If you need to purchase a [Potato Seed](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Potato_Seeds), leave one inventory slot empty. You will need a total of three empty inventory slots after selling Gems to the Blacksmith and upgrading the Pickaxe. Upgrading the Pickaxe will free up two slots. If you are also selling at least one Gem stack, you do not need to free any inventory slots.
9. Travel to the Blacksmith.

### Pelican Town (1)

1. Sell all Gems.
2. Using the spreadsheet, calculate how much G you will need to purchase the Seeds necessary to reach [Farming](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farming) level 2 on Spring 11.
3. Purchase enough Iron Ore and Gold Ore (purchase Iron Ore first, then Gold Ore) to have acquired 25 of each, including the Ore counts you tracked earlier. Be sure you save at least the amount of G you just calculated.
   - You will almost certainly not have enough G to acquire all 25 Gold Ore; this is expected. You will acquire the remainder on subsequent days.
4. Upgrade your Pickaxe to the Copper Pickaxe for 2,000g.
5. Travel to Pierre's General Store.
6. Purchase the following:
   - One Bean Starter
   - One Potato Seed if you did not get one from a Mixed Seed
   - [Kale Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Kale_Seeds) with the remainder of your G
     - You must purchase and plant enough Kale Seeds to reach Farming level 2 on Spring 11.
     - In rare cases, you will have far more G on this day than you should spend on Kale Seeds (e.g., if you sold a [Treasure Chest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Treasure_Chest) that you acquired from a fishing chest). In these cases, use your judgment about how many Kale Seeds are reasonable to plant and water. Be sure to account for the extra Seeds in your crop planner. Consider using extra money to purchase the first [Backpack](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tools#Other_Tools) upgrade now.
7. Travel to The Farm.

### The Farm (2)

1. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - Hoe
   - Purchased Seeds
   - Watering Can
2. Till, plant, and water crops.
3. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - Furnace
   - 25 Iron Ore
   - Up to 25 Gold Ore
   - 10 Coal
   - Chub
4. Travel to The Mountain fishing spot.

### The Mountain

1. Place the Furnace to the left of the Chest.
2. Fish until 1:50 am. Continuously smelt Iron Bars but stop once you've acquired five. If you've acquired five, begin smelting Gold Bars.
3. Update the spreadsheet to account for any Gold Ore you acquired while fishing.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into the Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - One Coal if you do not have one in The Farm Chest
   - The most profitable item stacks as calculated by the spreadsheet
   - Do not withdraw any Iron Ore, Iron Bars, Gold Ore, Gold Bars, or the rest of the Coal
5. Pass out.
