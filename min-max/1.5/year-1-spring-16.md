## Goals

- Mine and smelt

## Advice and warnings

- This is the last day you can craft the remaining required Sprinklers. Any later than today and the second Kale crop will not mature in time.

## Instructions

### The Farm (1)

1. If two days have elapsed since the last time you checked The Cave, check it now for Mushrooms.

   - Copper Bars required to make any remaining Sprinklers
   - Iron Bars required to make any remaining Sprinklers
   - Sources of Energy if you don't have them stored in the Chest in The Mines
   - Watering Can
3. Water crops that were not watered by Sprinklers.
4. Craft and place any remaining Sprinklers.
5. Deposit the Watering Can in a Chest.
6. Travel to The Mines using the repaired Minecart.

### The Mines

1. Withdraw the Gold Pickaxe from the Chest.
2. Resume your descent.
   - If you still need more Sprinklers, farm floors 21 for Copper Ore and 41 for Iron Ore first.
   - If you find missing Geologist's Bundle or Adventurer's Bundle items before day's end, you can return to the Community Center and complete the Bundle.
3. Mine until 1:50 am.
4. Deposit your entire inventory into a Chest. Withdraw the following:
   - Copper Bars required to craft Sprinklers
   - Iron Bars required to craft Sprinklers

### Day's end

- Mining level increases may occur
  - If you reach Mining level 5, choose the [Miner](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining/Skill) profession.
